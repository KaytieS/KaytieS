Hi! My name is Kaytie and I’m from Buffalo, New York. I have my bachelor’s degree in psychology from Niagara University and I am currently pursuing my online master’s degree in program evaluation and data analytics at ASU. In my free time I like to go to the gym, read (mostly sci-fi, psychology, or philosophy books), and spend time with my family, friends and boyfriend. I also like to go for hikes and spend time outdoors when the weather is nice.
